.SH NAME
modelicac \- modelicac is a compiler for a subset of the Modelica language including parts of the 'equation' subset that can express relations between Real variable.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmodelicac\fR [\fB-c\fR] [\fB-o\fR <outputfile>] <inputfile> [\fB-L\fR <directory> | \fB-hpath\fR <directory> | \fB-keep-all-variables\fR | \fB-jac\fR | \fB-no-parameter-removal\fR | \fB-no-simplifs\fR | \fB-only-outputs\fR | \fB-trace\fR <filename> | \fB-with-init-in\fR <init_input_file> | \fB-with-init-out\fR <init_output_file> | \fB-xml\fR ]

This manual page documents briefly the
.B modelicac
commands.
Note that modelicac is only available on the platform which are supported by
ocamlopt (ie amd64 hurd-i386 i386 powerpc sparc)
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
A complete list of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-c
Compile only, do not instantiate. Modelicac produces a "*.moc" file when invoked with that option.
.TP
.B \-o <outputfile>
Set output file name to <outputfile> (this option also works
with \-c option but is somewhat useless because of the class
name restrictions given above).
.TP
.B \-L <directory>
Add <directory> to the list of directories to be searched when
producing a C file (no effect when used with \-c).
.TP
.B \-hpath <directory>
Specify a path to be added to #include directives in the
generated C code.
.TP
.B \-keep-all-variables
 Do not remove any variable from the initial system.
.TP
.B \-jac
Generate analytic jacobian matrix code.
.TP
.B \-no-parameter-removal
Do not remove any parameter
.TP
.B \-no-simplifs
Same as \-keep\-all\-variables \-no\-parameter\-removal
.TP
.B \-only-outputs
Generate code only for declared outputs
(may have no effect depending on target)
.TP
.B \-trace <filename>
Generate tracing information for external function calls
into <filename>
.TP
.B \-with-init-in <init_input_file>
Generate initialization code and use the given file to get input data
(may have no effect depending on target)
.TP
.B \-with-init-out <init_output_file>
Generate initialization code and use the given file to generate output data
(may have no effect depending on target)
