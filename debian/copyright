  CeCILL FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
 .
 Version 2.1 dated 2013-06-21
 .
 .
    Notice
 .
 This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
 of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
 the two main principles guiding its drafting:
 .
  * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
    of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,
  * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it
    is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual
    property law, and the protection that it offers to both authors and
    holders of the economic rights over software.
 .
 The authors of the CeCILL (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[ogiciel] L[ibre]) 
 license are: 
 .
 Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives - CEA, a
 public scientific, technical and industrial research establishment,
 having its principal place of business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le
 Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.

 .
 .
    Preamble
 .
 The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
 the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
 license within the framework of an open source distribution model.
 .
 The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations for
 users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.
 .
 In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
 modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
 with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
 economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
 .
 In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
 and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
 the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
 complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
 developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
 knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
 suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
 enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
 more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
 security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
 provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
 removed herefrom.
 .
 This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
 the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.
 .
 Frequently asked questions can be found on the official website of the
 CeCILL licenses family (http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html) for any

 .
    Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES
 .
 7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to
 provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.

 However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
 terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
 maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
 Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
 shall incur liability therefor.

 legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
 shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
 any or all compensation from the Licensor.
 .
 .
    Article 9 - WARRANTY
 .
 9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
 state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
 possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
 possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
 attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
 modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
 reserved for experienced users.
 .
 The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
 the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
 order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
 or properties.
 .
 9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
 to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
 rights set forth in Article 5 <#scope>).
 .
 9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
 the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
 that provided for in Article 9.2 <#good-faith> and, in particular,
 without any warranty as to its commercial value, its secured, safe,
 innovative or relevant nature.
 .
 Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
 from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
 be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
 configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.
 .
 9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
 Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
 relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
 the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
 arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
 instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
 Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
 the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
 expertise for its defense. Such technical and legal expertise shall be
 decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
 Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
 disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the
 name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
 prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
 of a trademark.
 .
 .
    Article 10 - TERMINATION
 .
 10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations
 hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement
 thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has
 remained ineffective.
 .
 10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be
 authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any
 licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement
 shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance
 with the terms and conditions hereof.

 .
    Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS

 11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke
 one or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be
 interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to
 invoke said provision(s) subsequently.
 .
 11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements,
 whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same
 purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said
 Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the
 terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties
 unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized
 representatives.
 .
 11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to
 conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text,
 said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make
 the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative
 text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity
 of a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not
 cause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid.

               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.
 .
       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
  b. Other rights.
 .
       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.
 .
       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
  a. Attribution.
 .
       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:
 .
            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:
 .
                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);
 .
                ii. a copyright notice;
 .
               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;
 .
                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;
 .
            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.
 .
       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.
 .
       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;
 .
  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 .
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.
 .
  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or
 .
       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.
 .
  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.
 .
  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.
 .
  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.
 .
  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
