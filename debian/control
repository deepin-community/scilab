Description: Scientific software package - Command Line Interpreter
 Scilab is a matrix-based scientific software package.
 Scilab contains hundreds of built-in mathematical functions, rich
 data structures (including polynomials, rationals, linear systems, lists,
 etc...) and comes with a number of specific toolboxes for
 control, signal processing, ...
 .
 This package provides Scilab as Command Line Interpreter (CLI). This package
 provides Scilab as a computing engine or script interpreter.
 Please install the package "scilab" to have all features.
