Preparing the debian/copyright file is a nightmare, given the huge number of
copyright holders. I have prepared the shell script debian/prepare_copyright.sh
which can gather all the information scan-copyrights can gather, afterwards it
would need a manual treatment. Still the resulting file has tens of thousands
of lines.

For the moment, I will wtick to the practive of preceding maintainers and write
a very light file.
